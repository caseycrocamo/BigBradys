# Merry Christmas Mom!
## It's time for an update
I remember creating the first Big Brady's site in exchange for car insurance payments (I believe) way back in highschool. That makes the site *at least* 5 years old. A lot has changed in those 5 years, for both Big Brady's and my website building prowess, and it's high time [bigbradys.com](http://www.bigbradys.com/) reflects that.

## Some things for you to consider
* What are your goals for Big Bradys in the next year or two?
* What is the first thing you want someone to think about Big Bradys when they visit your new website?
* How often do you want to change content or elements on the new website? How involved do you want to be in this process?
* How much money are you willing to spend every year to keep your website up and running?

I'm excited to get started, think about your answers to those questions and we will talk soon. I love you!
Casey
